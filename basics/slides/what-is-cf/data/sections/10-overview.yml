  * An **open** Cloud Native Platform (PaaS)
  * Fast and easy to **build, test, deploy &amp; scale apps**
  * Works with **any language** or framework

notes: |

  Open-source with an Apache license, hosted on GitHub.

  Developers use the cf command line utility to interact with a CF deployment.
  The cf cli is pre-built for Windows, Mac and Linux.

  CF supports any language or framework through buildpacks. More on that subject later.
