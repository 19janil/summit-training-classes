notes: |
    On an app host, also known as a CELL (CF v3).
    The router sends traffic to the IP & port combination that match the Host header.
    Multiple app instances means traffic gets randombly distributed.
    Production Cloud Foundries use multiple routers for resiliency and many app hosts for a better app distribution.
