  Who **likes** being paged?
  
  * **Health monitor** pings VMs
  * If the VM doesn't respond **bosh recreates it**

notes: |

  The health manager in bosh constantly pings created vms.  When a VM is "gone", bosh recreates it.  No pages.  No manual intervention necessary.  This is critical to "day 2" operations.
